## Brief Description of Each Page

* **Main Page (main_page.html)**  
  This page serves as the primary interface for the Twitter feed. It includes a navigation bar and areas for posting new tweets as well as displaying the latest tweets. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

* **Login Page (login.html)**  
  The login page facilitates user authentication. It includes fields for username and password, options for account sign-up, and password recovery.

* **Profile Page (profile.html)**  
  Displays the user's profile, including their tweets, followers, and following. It's styled with a custom CSS file (`profile.css`).

* **Search Page (search.html)**  
  Allows users to search for specific topics or tweets. It features a search bar and displays popular topics.

## JavaScript Functionality

* **app.js**  
  Controls the main application logic. It includes functions for posting tweets, handling user authentication, and dynamically displaying tweets.

* **login.js**  
  Manages the login and signup functionalities. It handles form submission and communicates with the back-end server for user authentication.

## Technical Choices and Issues

* We utilized HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive user interface.
* For styling, a combination of custom CSS and Tailwind CSS was used.
* JavaScript was used for client-side scripting, enabling dynamic content management and API interactions.
* We faced challenges with CORS when attempting to communicate with the back-end server, and we are actively working to resolve these issues.
